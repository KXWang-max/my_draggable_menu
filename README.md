- all nodes are judged by their names ('根节点'/'父节点'/'叶子节点'/'新增节点').<br/>
- 根节点/父节点 can be added only.<br/>
- 新增节点 can be edited or removed.<br/>
<br/>
- when the 新增节点 is the first time to be added,if you don't enter the name,this node will be removed directly.<br/>
- when you just want to change a (新增节点)node's name which is exist,if you don't enter any words,it will be restored its original name.<br/>
<br/>
